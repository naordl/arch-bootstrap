# Dotfiles

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Have a base install of Arch Linux ready, along with a user that has `sudo` privileges.
- You should place this repository in `$HOME/.local/src/`, to keep your home directory clean.
- That's also where the script will download my dotfiles by default.

### Instructions
- Make the shell script executable using the following command: `chmod +x dabs.sh`.
- Execute the script `.\dabs.sh`.
- Follow on-screen instructions.
